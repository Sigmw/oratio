Most people who have delivered speeches in this place up to now have praised the ancient custom of honoring this among the people, those soldiers died in war, but it seems to me that today is the greatest praise of those who are celebrated in public. earned by their valor.

And it also seems to me that not one man speaks of such good soldiers' virtues and heroism, nor does he believe what he is saying, whether he is a good orator or an insolent man, for it is difficult to speak rightly. temper the praise by referring to the things, none of which can be effected except by a slight shadow of truth.

Because, if the hearer was a witness to things and loves the person of the speaker, he always believes that praise is insufficient on account of what he wants and what he knows, driven by contrast to what he does not know. It would seem that envy is an exaggeration in that it exceeds its nature.

Lauds uttered for another cannot be carried except insofar as one believes that they are capable of exercising these acts. Which overcomes us with envy and distrust.

But since our ancestors accepted and approved this custom, we must also obey it, and will endeavor to satisfy the desires and affections of each of you as far as I can.

And so I will begin to praise our ancestors. For it is just and fair to venerate the memory.

This country, inhabited without ceasing by the people of the same nation, has passed hand in hand to this day, always preserving its freedom for industry. And if those ancestors deserve our praise, much more are our parents. They have accepted the inheritance, they have added, what power of work and diligence we have, which they have left us. He raised us up. And in vigor of age we further enlarged that empire, and supplying the city with all things necessary both in peace and in war.

And so I will begin to praise our ancestors. For it is just and fair to venerate the memory.

I shall say nothing of the wars and deeds which allow us to reach our present place, nor the valor which we and our ancestors defend from the attacks of the barbarians or of the Greeks. You all know, and therefore I will not tell you. But the prudence and the art which led us to this end, must first be noted of the nature of the political institutions and the morals which have brought this authority to us. Then I will go on with the praise of our deceased.

Because, as it seems to me, it is opportune to mention these things at present, and it will be useful to both the citizens and the foreigners to hear those who have assembled today.

And so I will begin to praise our ancestors. For it is just and fair to venerate the memory.

I shall say nothing of the wars and deeds which allow us to reach our present place, nor the valor which we and our ancestors defend from the attacks of the barbarians or of the Greeks. You all know, and therefore I will not tell you. But the prudence and the art which led us to this end, must first be noted of the nature of the political institutions and the morals which have brought this authority to us. Then I will go on with the praise of our deceased.

Our political constitution does not follow the laws of other states, but is an example of them. Our government is called democracy, because the administration serves the interests of the greater and not of the lesser.

According to our laws we are all equal in private affairs. For public participation, however, each person gains his or her own consideration according to the merits of it and the higher personal value in which it belongs; This means that no one perceives an impediment to his poverty or social status, since his superiority is able to perform the tasks of the state.

What pertains to the republic, then, we should freely govern, and even in the relations which we daily keep with our allies and neighbors, we are not irritated because they act in their own way, nor do we regard their pleasures and joys. for example, humiliation, which, although not causing harm, causes sadness and sadness, although we always try to hide it.
And so I will begin to praise our ancestors. For it is just and fair to venerate the memory.

Since we are not afraid in private alliances, we are afraid to break even the laws of the republic; to the magistrates and the laws, which defend the oppressed; and, even if they are not enacted, let us obey, who violate the contempt of all.

To relieve work, we seek many recreations of the soul; We have instituted games and festivals every year; and the hobbies which daily delight us and lessen our sadness. The greatness and importance of our commonwealth attracts the treasures of other lands, so that we may enjoy not only our fruits, but also the whole world.

As far as war is concerned, we are very different from our enemies, because we allow our state to be disclosed to all nations and nations, without prohibiting or prohibiting anyone from acquiring information and knowledge, although that information may be beneficial to our adversaries; for we trust in our preparations and projects as much as we trust in our courage and courage.

Others, as far as education is concerned, train their manhood from infancy through the growth of discipline; We, though a way of life, are no less daring and brave to face danger, when necessity demands.
